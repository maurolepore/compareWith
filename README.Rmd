# compareWith: RStudio Diff / Merge Addins with VCS Capabilities

**compareWith** is an R package providing user-friendly [RStudio addins](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/) to make it easier to perform **diff** and **merge** tasks compared to the limited functionality offered by RStudio itself, especially with projects under version control.

Tasks **compareWith** greatly helps with include

- compare differences prior to commit, for individual files or the whole project;
- inspect and resolve merge conflicts via three-way comparison;
- compare two distinct files with each other.

The packgage relies on [**Meld**](http://meldmerge.org/), a common visual diff and merge tool.


## Installation

You can install the latest **compareWith** from GitHub using the [**remotes**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes) package
```{r github-install, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("miraisolutions/compareWith")
```

An installation of [Meld](http://meldmerge.org) is also required. Meld is available for most Linux/Unix distributions and can be easily installed, e.g. via `sudo apt-get install meld` on Debian/Ubuntu.

On Windows, the installation is supported by an MSI installer downloadable from the Meld website. After installation, you may have to add the location of the installed `meld.exe` to the `PATH` environment variable.

Meld is not yet officially supported on MacOS. However, it can be installed via MacPorts, Fink or Brew.


## Usage

The functionality of **compareWith** is accessible in RStudio using the _Addins_ menu.
